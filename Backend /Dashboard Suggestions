You can choose a backend approach depending on what you’re comfortable with. Some options:
Option	Pros	Cons
Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore	Quick setup, has SDKs / hosting, easy to use	Cost may rise, less control
AWS IoT Core + DynamoDB / S3 + Lambda	Scalable, production‑grade	More setup, can be more complex
Your own REST API + DB (Node.js, Python Flask/Django, etc.)	Full control, cheap, flexible	You need to host, maintain
MQTT broker + dashboard (Node‑RED / ThingsBoard / Grafana)	Good for real‑time dashboards, lots of community stuff	Slight learning curve
Dashboard could show:
Current moisture / temperature / humidity
Historical graph (over hours/days)
Status of pump (on/off)
Manual controls (turn pump on/off, set threshold)
Alerts / notifications
